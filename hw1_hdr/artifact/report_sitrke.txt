VFXproj1:

HDR: Debevec's method
1. Choose some pixels which lies on flat area in  gradient domain. 
2. Recover curve of each channel by using SVD to solve linear constraint
3. Interpolate pixel value by the recovering curves and origin series of images.

ToneMapping: Gradient Domain
1. Compute log image
2. According to parameters alpha (weighting), and beta (attenuation level), Find Attenuation map
3. Apply Attenuation on corresponding gradient
4. Solve Poisson equation to find out image after integration
5. Recover color infomation with paramter s
